### 1- Remove spaces from string
* calling `trim()` method on a string object removes the spaces around the text.

### 2- Convert String Number to Numerical Value
* `double.tryParse()` this method takes a string that contains a number and tries to convert it into a `double` (numerical value), it returns the number if it succeeded or `null` if it's non-convertable text.

### 3- Logical Operations
* `&&` operator is used when you have a *boolean* expression that needs all multiple conditions satisfied to evaluate to `true`.
* `||` operator is used when have multiple conditions but needs one to be satisfied at least to evaluate to `true`.
* you can combine multiple conditions, but you should use brackets `()` to be more explicit about the conditions your are compining, otherwise these operations have a specific order to be executed based on it and it might not give you the desired functionality.
