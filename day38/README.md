# Handling User Inputs & Forms
20-3-2024

### Form Widget
* `Form` widget is used to handle a combination of input fields.
* user input can be handled without this `Form` widget, but it gives us some extra features that can help in getting, validating user input and showing error messages on the screen. 
* when working with `Form` widget instead of using `TextField` we must use `TextFormField` widget because it integrates with features provided by `Form` widget.
* there are multiple widgets that is specific for hanlding user input that integrats with `Form` widget. 

### Extras
* be careful with class names, as you may have conflict with a class defined by Flutter.
* read the error message carfully and make sure of having the correct models pathes.
